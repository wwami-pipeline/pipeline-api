# pipeline-api
This API serves the Pipeline Mapping Project client-side application

## Tech and Dependencies
Built with TypeScript. Runs on Express.js. Transpiling handled by gulp. Uses mocha for tests.

## Setup
Setup should be as easy as pulling the repo and running `npm install` to get all the dependencies. There are two scripts that have been written
for ease of use:
* `build`: runs the gulp scripts specified in gulpfile.js. Will transpile everything into the `build` folder.
* `start`: starts the express server on port 3000
