Medical assistants help campers with testing their blood sugar before meals and bedtime, treat low blood sugars, and fill in for other staff as needed.

Diabetes counselors are assigned to a specific cabin and accompany their campers on activities throughout the week to help with diabetes management.  We ask that these volunteers attend camp for the whole week.  Room and board is provided for all volunteers.
